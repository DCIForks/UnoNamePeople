# Instructions

1. Use flexbox to layout the header, main and footer elements
2. Start with a column layout for Portrait mode, where the picture appears above the text div.
3. Create an @media rule to switch to a row layout when the page is wider than 800 px. Place the image to the right of the text div in this row layout.
4. Add normalize.css to obtain a consistent display of elements in different browsers.
